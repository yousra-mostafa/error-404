            <div class="accordion-body">Our story starts with a man who wondered about a better way. In 2007, Stuart Lombard made a personal goal to reduce his environmental footprint. After discovering that heating and cooling make up 40% to 60% of home energy use, he attempted to program his own thermostat to conserve energy while away on vacation. When he and his family returned home to Toronto to a shockingly cold house, he began to envision a better efficiency solution that could conserve energy without compromising comfort.

                Assembling a small team of likeminded experts, the new Canadian company of ecobee was formed. Together, the ecobee team was able to launch the first ever smart thermostat. Since then, ecobee customers across North America have saved more than 27.8 TWh of energy, which is the annual equivalent of saving enough energy to take all the homes in Los Angeles and Chicago off the grid for a year. And that impact continues to grow every day.</div>

                        work in the communities in need. A smart thermostat can mean saving on energy bills to those who
                        need it most, without sacrificing the comfort of home.

                        Since 2018, our Income Qualified (IQ) program has distributed over 20,000 smart thermostats to
                        improve comfort at home.
